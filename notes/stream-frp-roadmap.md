## Open Design Questions

### 1. Fusion Rules and Optimization

**Question**: How should we handle fusion of mixed pure/stateful streams?

**Current Approach**: Only fuse pure streams together
**Alternatives**:
- Partial fusion: Fuse pure subsequences within stateful streams
- Conditional fusion: Fuse based on runtime state analysis
- Compile-time fusion: Static analysis for fusion opportunities

**Research Needed**:
- Performance impact of different fusion strategies
- Correctness proofs for fusion transformations
- Integration with existing compiler optimizations

### 2. Performance Characteristics

**Question**: What are the performance characteristics of StatefulStream vs. traditional approaches?

**Metrics to Measure**:
- Memory allocation patterns
- CPU usage for different stream sizes
- Garbage collection impact
- Fusion optimization effectiveness

**Benchmarks Needed**:
- Comparison with RxJS/Observable patterns
- Comparison with imperative state management
- Comparison with other FRP implementations

### 3. Type Inference Complexity

**Question**: How can we improve type inference for complex compositions?

**Current Issues**:
- Complex type relationships in `compose` function
- Type inference breaks with `null` outputs in filters
- HKT integration complexity

**Potential Solutions**:
- Simplified type signatures with runtime checks
- Type-level programming for better inference
- Gradual typing approach

### 4. State Management Patterns

**Question**: What are the best patterns for complex state management?

**Areas to Explore**:
- Hierarchical state composition
- State sharing between parallel streams
- State persistence and serialization
- State migration and versioning

**Research Directions**:
- Integration with state management libraries
- Comparison with Redux-like patterns
- Integration with database state

## Potential Integration Points

### 1. Dependent Multiplicities

**Concept**: Extend the system to handle dependent multiplicities where the number of outputs depends on the input.

**Implementation Ideas**:
```typescript
// Dependent multiplicity: output count depends on input
type DependentStream<I, S, O> = StatefulStream<I, S, O[]>;

// Example: Split input into variable number of outputs
const splitStream = createDependentStream((input: string, state: number) => {
  const parts = input.split(',');
  return [state, parts];
});
```

**Research Questions**:
- How to compose streams with different multiplicities?
- Type safety for dependent multiplicity transformations
- Performance implications of variable output counts

### 2. Category-Theoretic Parallels to Optics

**Concept**: Explore the relationship between StatefulStream and optics (lenses, prisms, traversals).

**Parallels**:
- **Lenses**: Focus on specific parts of state
- **Prisms**: Handle optional/maybe-like state
- **Traversals**: Process multiple state elements
- **Getters/Setters**: Read/write state operations

**Implementation Ideas**:
```typescript
// Lens-like state focusing
const focusState = <S, F>(lens: Lens<S, F>) => 
  <I, O>(stream: StatefulStream<I, F, O>): StatefulStream<I, S, O> => {
    // Implementation using lens get/set
  };

// Prism-like state handling
const handleMaybeState = <S, F>(prism: Prism<S, F>) =>
  <I, O>(stream: StatefulStream<I, F, O>): StatefulStream<I, S, Maybe<O>> => {
    // Implementation using prism preview/review
  };
```

**Research Questions**:
- Can we derive optics from StatefulStream?
- How do optic laws translate to stream laws?
- Performance implications of optic-based state access

### 3. Integration with Existing Ecosystems

**ObservableLite Integration**:
- Bidirectional conversion between StatefulStream and ObservableLite
- Shared operator implementations
- Performance comparison and optimization

**React Integration**:
- StatefulStream as React state management
- Integration with React hooks
- Performance optimization for React rendering

**Node.js Integration**:
- Stream processing for Node.js streams
- Integration with async iterators
- Performance optimization for I/O operations

## Advanced Research Directions

### 1. Temporal Stream Processing

**Concept**: Extend StatefulStream to handle time-based operations.

**Implementation Ideas**:
```typescript
// Time-aware streams
type TemporalStream<I, S, O> = StatefulStream<[I, number], S, O>;

// Time-based operators
const delay = <I, S, O>(ms: number) => 
  (stream: StatefulStream<I, S, O>): TemporalStream<I, S, O> => {
    // Implementation with time delays
  };

const throttle = <I, S, O>(ms: number) =>
  (stream: StatefulStream<I, S, O>): TemporalStream<I, S, O> => {
    // Implementation with throttling
  };
```

**Research Questions**:
- How to handle time in pure functional streams?
- Integration with real-time systems
- Performance implications of time tracking

### 2. Probabilistic Streams

**Concept**: Extend StatefulStream to handle probabilistic operations.

**Implementation Ideas**:
```typescript
// Probabilistic streams
type ProbabilisticStream<I, S, O> = StatefulStream<I, S, [O, number]>;

// Probabilistic operators
const sample = <I, S, O>(probability: number) =>
  (stream: StatefulStream<I, S, O>): ProbabilisticStream<I, S, O> => {
    // Implementation with sampling
  };

const noise = <I, S, O>(variance: number) =>
  (stream: StatefulStream<I, S, O>): ProbabilisticStream<I, S, O> => {
    // Implementation with noise injection
  };
```

**Research Questions**:
- How to compose probabilistic streams?
- Statistical guarantees for stream operations
- Integration with machine learning pipelines

### 3. Distributed Stream Processing

**Concept**: Extend StatefulStream to handle distributed processing.

**Implementation Ideas**:
```typescript
// Distributed streams
type DistributedStream<I, S, O> = StatefulStream<I, S, Promise<O>>;

// Distribution operators
const distribute = <I, S, O>(nodes: string[]) =>
  (stream: StatefulStream<I, S, O>): DistributedStream<I, S, O> => {
    // Implementation with distribution
  };

const aggregate = <I, S, O>(strategy: AggregationStrategy) =>
  (stream: DistributedStream<I, S, O>): StatefulStream<I, S, O> => {
    // Implementation with aggregation
  };
```
